    <h4>It always starts with a cup of coffee, Odin.</h4>

<hr>

<p>"... Many have undertaken to draw up an account <br>
&nbsp; of the things that have been fulfilled among us, <br>
&nbsp; just as they were handed down to us by those who <br>
&nbsp; from the first were eyewitnesses and servants <br>
&nbsp; of the word. </p>

<p>With this in mind, since I myself have carefully <br>
&nbsp; investigated everything from the beginning, <br>
I too decided to write an orderly account for you, <br>
&nbsp; most excellent Theophilus, </p>

<p> so that you may know the certainty of the things <br>
you have been taught." </p>

<h5> &nbsp; - Luke 1-1:4 </h5>

<hr>

<p>“... If you don’t want to, you can make <br>
&nbsp; the people’s hearts not chaotic. </p>

<p>It’s the rule of the saints, the heart <br>
of the people, the belly, the weak, <br>
&nbsp; the strong bones. </p>

<p>Often the people are ignorant and have no desire. <br>
If the husband does not dare to do it, <br>
&nbsp; for nothing, then there is no cure.”</p>
